LEAGUE MANAGEMENT ENDPOINTS - SUMMARY
===============================================

✅ COMPLETED: Added 3 new league management endpoints

---

NEW ENDPOINTS:
--------------

1. PUT /api/leagues/{id}
   - Update league settings (change privacy)
   - Owner only
   - Claims-based authorization

2. DELETE /api/leagues/{id}
   - Delete league permanently
   - Owner only
   - Claims-based authorization

3. POST /api/leagues/{leagueId}/kick/{userId}
   - Remove member from league
   - Owner only
   - Claims-based authorization

---

AUTHORIZATION APPROACH:
-----------------------

✅ Claims-Based (current approach - simple and effective)
❌ Policy-Based (not implemented - not needed)
❌ Role-Based (not implemented - not needed)

How it works:
1. Extract user ID from JWT token
2. Fetch league from database
3. Check if currentUserId == league.Owner
4. Return 403 Forbidden if not owner
5. Proceed with operation if owner
